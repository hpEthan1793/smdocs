# System Requirements
- Windows 7 or higher
- Internet connection (for uploading to Chess-Results, using online JaVaFo pairing engine or downloading rating lists)
- Java Virtual Machine runtime (neccessary for using local JaVaFo pairing engine) - Download [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

_MacOS is not natively supported. However, you are able to run Swiss-Manager through WineHQ (a compatibility layer) on both Debian and Arch based Linux systems. So, it should theoretically be possible to get it to work on a Mac, however your mileage may vary._

# Installation

Download the installation file from the official website: [https://swiss-manager.at/download.aspx?lan=1](https://swiss-manager.at/download.aspx?lan=1)

![Download page](/4.png)

On the download page you will find the link to the latest version of Swiss-Manager as well as other
downloadable files such as the official handbook and user-guides. Once downloaded, run the installer and go
through the installation process. It is straightforward, so I won’t cover it here. The program supports Unicode
and comes in different languages which can be configured the first time you run the program.

Whenever there is an update available, you just need to download the new file from the website and run the
installer. No need to uninstall and re-install the program. To be safe, don’t update the program while you are
busy running a tournament just in case there is an unexpected bug.
