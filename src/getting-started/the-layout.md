# The Layout
The program has a very simple and intuitive layout. In the top left of the title bar of the window, you will see the
program name and the build number (version) in brackets. Just next to that you will also see the name of the
tournament you are working with and in brackets the system (e.g. Swiss or Round Robin).

Below the title bar is the main dropdown menu bar with items. These menu items contain various windows and
dialogs that you will make use of during a tournament. For example, under **Input** you can enter results, add
players, set round dates and times etc.

Below the menu bar is a set of icons. These icons are just shortcuts to some of the dropdown menu items. It’s
faster to click these than to first go into the menu and find the item you want. However, there are also keyboard
shortcuts that you can learn if you want to quickly access different options.

On the very bottom left of the window, you will see information of what is currently selected. On the bottom
right-hand side, you will see the name of the tournament file, Cnt which represents the total number of players
entered, Rd for the current round and the right at the end the current output (screen, printer, file).
